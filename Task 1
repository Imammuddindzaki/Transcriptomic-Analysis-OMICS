Transcriptome Analysis of The Phosphate Starvation Response Sheds Light on Strigolactone Biosynthesis in Rice
Introduction : Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development, yet the availability of its inorganic form (Pi) in soil is frequently limited. Phosphate deficiency triggers a suite of physiological and molecular adaptive responses in plants, including modifications to root system architecture and reconfiguration of hormonal regulatory networks. Strigolactones (SLs), a class of terpenoid lactone plant hormones, have been implicated in this response. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of SLs in the Pi deficiency response and their interconnection with transcriptomic reprogramming remain incompletely understood. This study aims to analyze the transcriptomic response of rice (Oryza sativa) to Pi starvation stress and to investigate the critical role of strigolactones in mediating this process.
Methodology : This study employed a transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) approach on root tissues of wild-type rice plants and a strigolactone-deficient mutant, d10 (defective in the CCD8 gene). Treatments included control (Pi-sufficient) conditions, chronic Pi deficiency (1, 3, 7, and 8 days), Pi resupply, and application of the synthetic strigolactone analog GR24. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 software, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and gene co-expression network construction to identify novel candidate genes involved in SL biosynthesis.
Result : Pi starvation stress induced significant alterations in the transcriptomic profile, particularly in genes encoding phosphate transporters (PHTs/PTs), SPX-domain proteins, and genes involved in lipid metabolism and acid phosphatase activity. Further analysis revealed that most key genes in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway, such as D27, CCD7, CCD8, and MAX1, were strongly upregulated during Pi deficiency and repressed upon Pi resupply. In the d10 mutant, the transcriptomic response pattern to Pi stress was markedly altered, indicating that a substantial portion of the Pi starvation response is strigolactone-dependent. Co-expression network analysis successfully identified a previously uncharacterized methyltransferase gene.
Discussion : These findings confirm the central role of strigolactones as a master regulator in the transcriptomic reprogramming in response to Pi deficiency in rice. The identification of a methyltransferase gene postulated to catalyze the conversion of carlactonoic acid to methyl carlactonoate provides significant insight into the mapping of the non-canonical SL biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, the observed interaction between strigolactone signaling, carotenoid biosynthesis, and abscisic acid (ABA) pathways suggests a complex and integrated hormonal regulatory mechanism in maintaining phosphate homeostasis.
Conclusion : This study concludes that phosphate deficiency induces extensive transcriptomic reprogramming in Oryza sativa, with strigolactones playing a pivotal mediating role. The identification of novel genetic components in the SL biosynthetic pathway provides fundamental insights into plant adaptation mechanisms to abiotic stress and opens potential avenues for application in breeding programs for crops tolerant to low Pi availability.
